How does your agent work? How does it generate new states, and how does it test them?
BFS + recording a tree. Generates all valid states and adds them to the queue only after testing them. Validity tests

How well does your agent perform? Does it struggle on any particular cases?
It's slower when the optimal solution is longer. But no, it doesn't struggle.


How efficient is your agent? How does its performance change as the number of animals rises?
O(n*m) rough upper bound.

Does your agent do anything particularly clever to try to arrive at an answer more efficiently?
Not really, but pre-tests the states.

How does your agent compare to a human? Does your agent solve the problem the same way you would?
Yes
